A URL shortener is a tool or service that takes a long URL and converts it into a shorter, more manageable link. This shortened link redirects users to the original, longer URL. URL shorteners are commonly used to make links easier to share, especially on platforms with character limits, such as Twitter. They can also be used to track link clicks and gather analytics.

<b>Hereâ€™s how it typically works:</b>

Input the Long URL: You provide the URL shortener service with the original, long URL.
Generate Short URL: The service generates a shorter version of the URL, often using a combination of letters and numbers.
Share the Short URL: You can then share the short URL, which redirects users to the original long URL when clicked.
Examples of URL Shortening Services:

Bit.ly

TinyURL

goo.gl (discontinued but still used)

Ow.ly (Hootsuite)

T2M

<b>Benefits:</b>

Convenience: Easier to share and manage links.
Tracking and Analytics: Some services provide detailed statistics on link clicks.
Aesthetic: Short URLs look cleaner, especially in print or digital media.
Usage Example:

Long URL: https://www.example.com/some/very/long/path/to/a/resource

Short URL: https://bit.ly/2A1b2C3
